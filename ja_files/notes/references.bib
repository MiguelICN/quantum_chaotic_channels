	abstract = {The Lindblad description of an open quantum system gives rise to two types of integrability, since the nonequilibrium steady state can be integrable independently of the Liouvillian. Taking boundary-driven and dephasing spin chains as a representative example, we discriminate Liouvillian and steady-state chaos by combining level spacing statistics and an extension of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis to open quantum systems. Moreover, we analyze the structure of the steady states by expanding it in the basis of Pauli strings and comparing the weight of strings of different lengths. We show that the natural expectation that integrable steady states are "simple" (i.e., built from few-body local operators) does not hold: the steady states of both chaotic and integrable models have relevant contributions coming from Pauli strings of all possible lengths, including long-range and many-body interactions. Nevertheless, we show that one can effectively use the operator-size distribution to distinguish chaotic and integrable steady states.},

	doi = {10.1109/TIT.2023.3263645},
	abstract = {Estimating the unitarity of an unknown quantum channel \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{E\}\$ provides information on how much it is unitary, which is a basic and important problem in quantum device certification and benchmarking. Unitarity estimation can be performed with either coherent or incoherent access, where the former in general leads to better query complexity while the latter allows more practical implementations. In this paper, we provide a unified framework for unitarity estimation, which induces ancilla-efficient algorithms that use \$O({\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}\{-2\})\$ and \$O({\textbackslash}sqrt\{d\}{\textbackslash}cdot{\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}\{-2\})\$ calls to \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{E\}\$ with coherent and incoherent accesses, respectively, where \$d\$ is the dimension of the system that \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{E\}\$ acts on and \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ is the required precision. We further show that both the \$d\$-dependence and \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$-dependence of our algorithms are optimal. As part of our results, we settle the query complexity of the distinguishing problem for depolarizing and unitary channels with incoherent access by giving a matching lower bound \${\textbackslash}Omega({\textbackslash}sqrt\{d\})\$, improving the prior best lower bound \${\textbackslash}Omega({\textbackslash}sqrt[3]\{d\})\$ by Aharonov et al. (Nat. Commun. 2022) and Chen et al. (FOCS 2021).},
